The city is like a treasure trove of Belizean history and culture that has long been forgotten.As a result, the Government of Belize has been working in collaboration with the TaiwanICDF since 2014 on developing the Downtown of Belize City into a rich eco-museum, composed of a selection of historical buildings such as the famous Government House and St. John’s Cathedral.", image: UIImage(named: "bg1")!)
