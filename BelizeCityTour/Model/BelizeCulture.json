At one time, there were three cannons displayed in the park, two of which were used in the famous Battle of St. George's Caye and mounted in the park to commemorate this historic 1798 battle. The third was a World War I German cannon in recognition of the brave Belizeans who proudly fought that war. Today, Mule Park stands in the heart of Belize City as a symbol of the country's rich history. Make sure to take a photo as a souvenir when you pass it by!",
